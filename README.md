# Grade Calculator

This project implements a simple grade calculator that allows you to manage courses, sections, and assignments. The code contains classes to track courses, assignments, and sections, calculate grades, and manage sections and assignments dynamically.

## Classes

**Layouts:** A singleton class to generate unique IDs for each course.  
**Course:** Represents a course with a name, grade, and sections.  
**Section:** Represents a section of a course, allowing you to decide whether it contributes to the overall grade.  
**Assignment:** Represents an assignment with a name, maximum points, earned points, and the ability to calculate its percentage.
